## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Firebase not defined" error

**Solution:** Make sure `firebase-config.js` is loaded BEFORE `app.js` in your HTML:
```html
<script src="firebase-config.js"></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

### Problem: Reports not syncing

**Solutions:**
1. Check the browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify your Firebase config is correct in `firebase-config.js`
3. Make sure Firestore is enabled in Firebase Console
4. Check that security rules are published

### Problem: "Permission denied" errors

**Solutions:**
1. Go to Firestore ‚Üí Rules tab
2. Make sure rules allow `allow read: if true;`
3. Click "Publish" again

### Problem: Can't see reports from other users

**Solution:** 
1. Make sure both browsers/devices are using the SAME Firebase project
2. Check that `firebase-config.js` has the correct `projectId`
3. Wait 2-3 seconds for real-time sync to kick in

## üîí Security Notes (Important!)

**Current Security Level:** üî¥ OPEN (Test Mode)
